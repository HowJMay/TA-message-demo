## Introduction

This is a demonstration, library for easy usage of MAM.
To demonstrate more clear and comprehensive usage of MAM, both sending and receiving message operation in example programs use NTRU to encode and decode the messages.

## Build instructions
User can use files in example to send and receive messages through MAM.

To build `send_message`
```
bazel build //examples:send_message
```

To build `receive_message`
```
bazel build //examples:send_message
```

## Usage
For `send_message` you can give the command as following.
```
./send_message <payload> <NTRU_public_key>
```
<"payload"> is the message that user want to send to MAM.
<"NTRU_public_key"> is the NTRU public key that can be used to encode the message.
This public key is generated by the receiver.

For `receive_message` you can take the following steps to receive a message from tangle.
run
```
./receive_message
```
then the program will generate a NTRU key pair that `send_message` needs to encode a message, and print the NTRU public key.

Then you have to inpput `bundle hash`, `chid (channel ID)` and `epid (endpoint ID)` sequentially.
These information will be generated after `send_message` sent a message sucessfully.

After you input all the information which were asked correctly, the message will be printed on terminal.

## Requirements
bazel
